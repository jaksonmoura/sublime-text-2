#SASS Snippets

## A collection of Sublime Text 2 snippets & functions to be used with SASS. Most snippets are to be used specifically with .scss

### Installation:
Install with Package Control

### Tab Triggers:

Use the name of the snippet, e.g. `fade-in` for `fade-in.sublime-snippet` as the tab trigger. If the name has an `@` at the start, ignore it & use the rest, e.g. `if` for the `@if.sublime-snippet`.
